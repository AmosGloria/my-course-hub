## NPM(Node Package Manager): NPM is the default package manager for Node.js. NPM helps developers to install, share, and manage dependencies for their projects. It is installed in a program when Node.js is installed.

## Package.json: Package.json is a special file that describes Node.js projects. A package can be described as toolkits containing tools that are designed to make a program perform efficiently.  It is a self-contained unit designed to be easily transferred, installed, and managed on a computer system. It contains information about the app such as the name, version, dependencies, scripts and more. Package.json can be installed by running npm init in the project folder which will ask a series of questions and generate package.json. You can also run npm init -y for quick setups.
## These packages often include:
## The actual executable programs or libraries (the software itself)
## Configuration files necessary for the software to run properly
## Documentation such as manuals or readme files
## Metadata that describes the software’s version, dependencies, and installation instructions

## Every web application project typically includes this file called package.json, which serves as a central repository for important project metadata. This file holds information such as dependencies, development dependencies, and peer dependencies, all of which are essential for managing the packages required to build, run, and maintain your project.

## Vite: Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
